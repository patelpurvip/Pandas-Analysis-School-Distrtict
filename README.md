# Pandas Analysis of School District Math & Reading Testing Data

![Education](Images/panda.png)

This exercise was designed to simiulate district-wide analysis for a local school board, with the aim of helping to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. To this end, the task required analyzing district-wide standardized test results through the use of Python Pandas. The original datasets provided math and reading scores for every student in the district, as well as information on the schools they attended. The first step was to aggregate the data to and evaluate trends in school performance.

The final evaluations included:
1. a District Summary
2. Summary statistics for each school
3. Identification of the top & bottom performing schools (by passing rate)
4. Math & Reading Scores by Grade Level
5. Scores by School Spending
6. Scores by School Size
7. Scores by School Type

-----
## 1) District Summary
The district summary provides a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
* Total Schools
* Total Students
* Total Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

-----
## 2) School Summary
The summary-by-school provides an overview of key metrics, including:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate

-----
## 3) Outlier Schools
These tables highlight the top-5 and bottom-5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate (OPR), with the following detail:
* School Name
* School Type
* Total Students
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
* Average Math Score
* Average Reading Score
* % Passing Math
* % Passing Reading
* Overall Passing Rate

### 3a) Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

### 3b) Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

-----
## 4) Scores by Grade\*\*
These tables show the average math & reading Scores for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
### 4a) Math Scores by Grade

### 4b) Reading Scores by Grade

-----
## 5) Scores by School Spending
This evaluation breaks down school performances based on "spending ranges" for average spending per student), including:
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate

-----
## 6) Scores by School Size
This table provides a similar school spending breakdown, but based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

-----
## 7) Scores by School Type
The final analysis comapres massing math and reading rates, as well as OPR, this time based on school type (Charter vs. District).
